# IOSXE Provider

The IOSXE provider provides resources to interact with one or more Cisco IOS-XE devices. There are a few [Terraform Modules](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=iosxe) for specific use cases available (e.g., managing a Catalyst 9000 EVPN fabric).

It communicates with IOS-XE devices via the RESTCONF API, which requires the following device configuration.

```
ip http secure-server
restconf
```

All resources and data sources have been tested with the following releases.

| Platform       | Version |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Catalyst 8000v | 17.12.4 |
| Catalyst 8000v | 17.15.3 |
| Catalyst 9000v | 17.15.1 |
