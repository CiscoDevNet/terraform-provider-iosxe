# IOSXE Provider

The IOSXE provider provides resources to interact with one or more Cisco IOS-XE devices. The provider supports both **RESTCONF** (HTTPS-based) and **NETCONF** (SSH-based) protocols for device communication.

## Device Configuration

### RESTCONF (Default)

RESTCONF is the default protocol and requires the following device configuration:

```
ip http secure-server
restconf
```

### NETCONF

NETCONF protocol provides additional capabilities including transactional commits with the candidate datastore:

```
netconf-yang
netconf-yang feature candidate-datastore
```

See the **[NETCONF Guide](guides/netconf)** for detailed information on using NETCONF protocol, including configuration commit modes and transactional workflows.

All resources and data sources have been tested with the following releases.

| Platform       | Version |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Catalyst 8000v | 17.12.4 |
| Catalyst 8000v | 17.15.3 |
| Catalyst 9000v | 17.15.1 |
