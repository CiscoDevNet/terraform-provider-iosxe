# IOSXE Provider

The IOSXE provider provides resources to interact with one or more Cisco IOS-XE devices. There are a few [Terraform Modules](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=iosxe) for specific use cases available (e.g., managing a Catalyst 9000 EVPN fabric).

It communicates with IOS-XE devices via the RESTCONF API, which requires the following device configuration.

```
ip http secure-server
restconf
```

All resources and data sources have been tested with the following releases.

| Platform       | Version |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Catalyst 8000v | 17.12.4 |
| Catalyst 8000v | 17.15.3 |
| Catalyst 9000v | 17.15.1 |

## Guides

The following guides are available to help you get started with the IOSXE provider:

- **[Manage Multiple Devices](guides/manage_multiple_devices)** - Learn how to manage multiple IOS-XE devices using provider aliases or the single-provider approach with device-level management control
- **[Selective Deploy](guides/selective_deploy)** - Deploy configurations to a subset of devices while keeping others in a "frozen" state for staged rollouts and maintenance scenarios
- **[Importing Resources](guides/importing_resources)** - Import existing device configurations into Terraform state management
- **[Destroying Resources](guides/destroying_resources)** - Control resource destruction behavior using delete modes
- **[Changelog](guides/changelog)** - Review version history and breaking changes

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "iosxe" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  url      = "https://10.1.1.1"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `devices` (Attributes List) This can be used to manage a list of devices from a single provider. All devices must use the same credentials. Each resource and data source has an optional attribute named `device`, which can then select a device by its name from this list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--devices))
- `insecure` (Boolean) Allow insecure HTTPS client. This can also be set as the IOSXE_INSECURE environment variable. Defaults to `true`.
- `lock_release_timeout` (Number) Number of seconds to wait for the device database lock to be released. This can also be set as the IOSXE_LOCK_RELEASE_TIMEOUT environment variable. Defaults to `120`.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for the IOS-XE device. This can also be set as the IOSXE_PASSWORD environment variable.
- `retries` (Number) Number of retries for REST API calls. This can also be set as the IOSXE_RETRIES environment variable. Defaults to `10`.
- `selected_devices` (List of String) This can be used to select a list of devices to manage from the `devices` list. Selected devices will be managed while other devices will be skipped and their state will be frozen. This can be used to deploy changes to a subset of devices. Defaults to all devices.
- `url` (String) URL of the Cisco IOS-XE device. Optionally a port can be added with `:12345`. The default port is `443`. This can also be set as the IOSXE_URL environment variable.
- `username` (String) Username for the IOS-XE device. This can also be set as the IOSXE_USERNAME environment variable.

### Nested Schema for `devices`

Required:

- `name` (String) Device name.
- `url` (String) URL of the Cisco IOS-XE device.

Optional:

- `managed` (Boolean) Enable or disable device management. This can be used to temporarily skip a device due to maintainance for example. Defaults to `true`.
