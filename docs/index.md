# IOSXE Provider

The IOSXE provider provides resources to interact with one or more Cisco IOS-XE devices. There are a few [Terraform Modules](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=iosxe) for specific use cases available (e.g., managing a Catalyst 9000 EVPN fabric).

The following example repositories exist to demonstrate the use of the provider:

- [Catalyst 9000 EVPN Fabric](https://github.com/netascode/terraform-iosxe-evpn-example)

It communicates with IOS-XE devices via the RESTCONF API, which requires the following device configuration.

```
ip http secure-server
restconf
```

All resources and data sources have been tested with the following releases.

| Platform       | Version |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Catalyst 8000v | 17.6.5  |
| Catalyst 8000v | 17.9.4  |
| Catalyst 9000v | 17.13.1 |

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "iosxe" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  url      = "https://10.1.1.1"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `devices` (Attributes List) This can be used to manage a list of devices from a single provider. All devices must use the same credentials. Each resource and data source has an optional attribute named `device`, which can then select a device by its name from this list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--devices))
- `insecure` (Boolean) Allow insecure HTTPS client. This can also be set as the IOSXE_INSECURE environment variable. Defaults to `true`.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for the IOS-XE device. This can also be set as the IOSXE_PASSWORD environment variable.
- `retries` (Number) Number of retries for REST API calls. This can also be set as the IOSXE_RETRIES environment variable. Defaults to `10`.
- `url` (String) URL of the Cisco IOS-XE device. Optionally a port can be added with `:12345`. The default port is `443`. This can also be set as the IOSXE_URL environment variable.
- `username` (String) Username for the IOS-XE device. This can also be set as the IOSXE_USERNAME environment variable.
