# IOSXE Provider

The IOSXE provider provides resources to interact with one or more Cisco IOS-XE devices. There are a few [Terraform Modules](https://registry.terraform.io/browse/modules?provider=iosxe) for specific use cases available (e.g., managing a Catalyst 9000 EVPN fabric).

It communicates with IOS-XE devices via the RESTCONF API, which requires the following device configuration.

```
ip http secure-server
restconf
```

All resources and data sources have been tested with the following releases.

| Platform       | Version |
| -------------- | ------- |
| Catalyst 8000v | 17.12.4 |
| Catalyst 8000v | 17.15.3 |
| Catalyst 9000v | 17.15.1 |

## Guides

The following guides are available to help you get started with the IOSXE provider:

- **[Manage Multiple Devices](guides/manage_multiple_devices)** - Learn how to manage multiple IOS-XE devices using provider aliases or the single-provider approach with device-level management control
- **[Selective Deploy](guides/selective_deploy)** - Deploy configurations to a subset of devices while keeping others in a "frozen" state for staged rollouts and maintenance scenarios
- **[Importing Resources](guides/importing_resources)** - Import existing device configurations into Terraform state management
- **[Destroying Resources](guides/destroying_resources)** - Control resource destruction behavior using delete modes
- **[Changelog](guides/changelog)** - Review version history and breaking changes

## Example Usage

```terraform
provider "iosxe" {
  username = "admin"
  password = "password"
  url      = "https://10.1.1.1"
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `devices` (Attributes List) This can be used to manage a list of devices from a single provider. All devices must use the same credentials. Each resource and data source has an optional attribute named `device`, which can then select a device by its name from this list. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--devices))
- `host` (String) Hostname or IP address of the Cisco IOS-XE device. Optionally a port can be added with `:port`. Default port is `443` for RESTCONF and `830` for NETCONF. This can also be set as the IOSXE_HOST environment variable.
- `insecure` (Boolean) Allow insecure HTTPS client. This can also be set as the IOSXE_INSECURE environment variable. Defaults to `true`.
- `lock_release_timeout` (Number) Number of seconds to wait for the device database lock to be released. This can also be set as the IOSXE_LOCK_RELEASE_TIMEOUT environment variable. Defaults to `120`.
- `password` (String, Sensitive) Password for the IOS-XE device. This can also be set as the IOSXE_PASSWORD environment variable.
- `protocol` (String) Protocol to use for device communication. Either `restconf` (HTTPS) or `netconf` (SSH). This can also be set as the IOSXE_PROTOCOL environment variable. Defaults to `restconf`.
- `retries` (Number) Number of retries for REST API calls. This can also be set as the IOSXE_RETRIES environment variable. Defaults to `10`.
- `reuse_connection` (Boolean) Keep NETCONF connections open between operations for better performance. When disabled, connections are closed and reopened for each operation. Only applies to NETCONF protocol. This can also be set as the IOSXE_REUSE_CONNECTION environment variable. Defaults to `true`.
- `selected_devices` (List of String) This can be used to select a list of devices to manage from the `devices` list. Selected devices will be managed while other devices will be skipped and their state will be frozen. This can be used to deploy changes to a subset of devices. Defaults to all devices.
- `url` (String, Deprecated) URL of the Cisco IOS-XE device for RESTCONF protocol. Optionally a port can be added with `:12345`. The default port is `443`. This can also be set as the IOSXE_URL environment variable. **Deprecated: Use `host` instead for protocol-agnostic configuration.**
- `username` (String) Username for the IOS-XE device. This can also be set as the IOSXE_USERNAME environment variable.

### Nested Schema for `devices`

Required:

- `name` (String) Device name.

Optional:

- `host` (String) Hostname or IP address of the Cisco IOS-XE device. Optionally a port can be added with `:port`.
- `managed` (Boolean) Enable or disable device management. This can be used to temporarily skip a device due to maintainance for example. Defaults to `true`.
- `url` (String, Deprecated) URL of the Cisco IOS-XE device for RESTCONF protocol. **Deprecated: Use `host` instead.**
