## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
terraform import iosxe_flow_record.example "Cisco-IOS-XE-native:native/flow/Cisco-IOS-XE-flow:record=FNF1"
```
