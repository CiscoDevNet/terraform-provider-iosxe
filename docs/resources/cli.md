# iosxe_cli (Resource)

This resources is used to configure arbitrary CLI commands. This should be considered a last resort in case YANG models are not available, as it cannot read the state and therefore cannot reconcile changes.

The resource uses different Cisco IOS-XE RPC methods depending on the `raw` parameter:

- **Transactional mode (`raw = false`, default)**: Uses `config-ios-cli-trans` RPC which provides transactional semantics with automatic rollback on failure. However, it only supports native IOS configuration CLIs that have corresponding IOS-XE YANG model support. This mode does not support non-native IOS config CLIs for features such as wireless, app-hosting, telemetry, etc.

- **Raw mode (`raw = true`)**: Uses `config-ios-cli-rpc` RPC which supports all IOS native and non-native configuration CLIs regardless of whether they are modeled in YANG. However, configuration changes are non-transactional and no automatic rollback on failure is performed. NETCONF/RESTCONF is used as a transport mechanism only.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "iosxe_cli" "example" {
  cli = <<-EOT
  interface Loopback123
  description configured-via-cli
  EOT
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `cli` (String) This attribute contains the CLI commands.

### Optional

- `device` (String) A device name from the provider configuration.
- `raw` (Boolean) Determines which RPC method is used to send CLI commands. When `false` (default), uses the transactional `config-ios-cli-trans` RPC which provides automatic rollback on failure but only supports native IOS CLIs with YANG model support. When `true`, uses the `config-ios-cli-rpc` RPC which supports all IOS native and non-native CLIs but without transactional guarantees or automatic rollback.
