# iosxe_commit (Action)

This action is used to commit the candidate config to the running config (NETCONF only) and optionally save the running config to startup config (both NETCONF and RESTCONF).

## Example Usage

```terraform
action "iosxe_commit" "example" {
  config {
    device      = "router1"
    save_config = true
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Optional

- `device` (String) A device name from the provider configuration.
- `save_config` (Boolean) Save running configuration to startup configuration. Equivalent to 'copy running-config startup-config'. For NETCONF devices, this saves after commit. For RESTCONF devices, this saves the current running configuration (RESTCONF is stateless, no commit needed). Defaults to `false`.
